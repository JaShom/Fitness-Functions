# Fitness-Functions
Fitness functions written in python
Made this because it was most functions are written in matlab or C. Others take too long to find.
Here you should:
Sphere Funtion
Rastrigin Function
Schwefel 1.2 Function
Rosenbrock
Ackley
Griewank
Lunacek’s Bi-Rastrigin
Schaffer N0 6
Goldstein-Price
Six-Hump Camel
Shifted Rastrigin
Shifted Rosenbrock

I will try to add more in the future.
