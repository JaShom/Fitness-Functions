# Fitness-Functions
Fitness functions written in python.\
Made this because most functions are written in matlab or C. Others take too long to find.\
Here you should:\
Sphere Funtion\
Rastrigin Function\
Schwefel 1.2 Function\
Rosenbrock\
Ackley\
Griewank\
Lunacekâ€™s Bi-Rastrigin\
Schaffer N0 6\
Goldstein-Price\
Six-Hump Camel\
Shifted Rastrigin\
Shifted Rosenbrock

I will try to add more in the future.
